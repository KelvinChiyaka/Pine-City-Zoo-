                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear species native to China, known for its distinctive
                    black and white fur. Pandas primarily inhabit bamboo forests in the mountainous regions of central
                    China, where they spend most of their time eating bamboo, which makes up about 99% of their diet.
                    Despite being classified as carnivores, they have adapted to a herbivorous diet.</p>
                <p>Pandas are solitary animals, except during mating season or when a mother is raising her cubs. They
                    are known for their gentle nature and playful behavior, especially when young. Pandas play a crucial
                    role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of bamboo forests through their feeding
                    habits. Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect their natural habitat and increase
                    their population, as they were once considered endangered.</p>
