                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance with large ears and
                    a
                    stout, tailless body. They primarily inhabit eucalyptus forests and are famous for their diet of
                    eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrition and require them to sleep up to 20 hours a day to
                    conserve
                    energy.</p>
                <p>Koalas are solitary animals, typically living alone except for mothers with their young. They have a
                    unique vocalization that can be heard during the breeding season, which sounds like a deep bellow.
                    Koalas
                    play a crucial role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of eucalyptus forests
                    through
                    their feeding habits.</p>
                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the koala at pen E24, right next to the gorilla.</p>
