                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs. They inhabit savannas and
                    open woodlands in Africa, primarily feeding on leaves from tall trees. Their unique coat patterns
                    help them blend into their environment, providing camouflage from predators.</p>
                <p>Giraffes are social animals, often found in loose herds. They have a distinctive gait, moving both
                    legs on one side of their body at the same time, which gives them a unique walking style. Giraffes
                    communicate through various vocalizations and body language, including
                    necking, a behavior where males swing their necks to establish dominance or compete for mates.</p>
                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the giraffe at pen E21, right next to the gemsbok.</p>
