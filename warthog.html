                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family, native to sub-Saharan
                    Africa.
                    They are easily recognized by their distinctive tusks and facial warts. Warthogs are primarily
                    herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, and fruits.</p>
                <p>Warthogs are known for their unique behavior of kneeling on their front knees while feeding, which
                    allows them to reach low vegetation. They are social animals, often found in small groups called
                    sounders,
                    typically consisting of females and their young, while males tend to be more solitary or form
                    bachelor groups.
                    Warthogs play an important role in their ecosystem by helping to aerate the soil and control
                    vegetation
                    growth through their foraging activities.</p>

                </strong>
                <p>You will find the gorilla at pen E22, right next to the giraffe.</p>
