                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent primates known for their playful behavior and social structures. They
                    are found in various habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions.
                    Monkeys are characterized by their long limbs, prehensile tails, and expressive faces.</p>
                <p>Monkeys are social animals that live in troops, which can range from a few individuals to several
                    hundred. They communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. Their diet
                    primarily consists of fruits, leaves, seeds, and insects, although some species may also consume
                    small animals. Monkeys play a crucial role in their ecosystems by aiding in seed dispersal and
                    maintaining the health of their habitats.</p>
