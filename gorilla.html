                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>The gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) is the largest living primate and is native to the forests of central
                    and western Africa. Known for their impressive size and strength, gorillas are primarily
                    herbivorous,
                    feeding on leaves, stems, and fruit. They live in social groups led by a dominant silverback.</p>
                <p>Gorillas are highly intelligent animals, exhibiting complex social behaviors and communication
                    skills.
                    They are known for their gentle nature, despite their formidable appearance. Gorillas play a crucial
                    role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of the forests they inhabit through seed
                    dispersal.</p>
                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the gorilla at pen E22, right next to the giraffe.</p>
