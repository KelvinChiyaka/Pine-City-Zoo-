                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous feline native to Africa and parts of Asia. Known as
                    the
                    "king of the jungle," lions are social animals that live in groups called prides, which typically
                    consist of related females and their offspring, along with a small number of adult males. Lions are
                    apex predators and play a crucial role in their ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Lions are known for their majestic manes, which vary in color and size among individuals. They are
                    powerful hunters, primarily preying on large ungulates such as zebras and wildebeests. Despite their
                    strength, lions face threats from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, leading to a decline in
                    their populations in the wild.</p>

                </strong>
                <p>You will find the lion at pen E22, right next to the koala.</p>
