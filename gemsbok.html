                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope species native to the southern African region.
                    It is known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and
                    white facial pattern. Gemsboks are well adapted to arid environments, primarily inhabiting
                    savannas and semi-desert areas. They are social animals, often found in herds, and are known for
                    their endurance and ability to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
                <p>Gemsboks are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and browsing on shrubs. They have a unique
                    ability to regulate their body temperature, allowing them to thrive in extreme heat. Their
                    horns, which can reach lengths of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet), are used for defense against predators
                    such as lions and hyenas.</p>

                </strong>
                <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E23, right next to the elephants.</p>
